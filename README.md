## Problem Statement
When online payments fail or customers abandon checkouts, businesses lose significant revenue due to static, generic, or poorly timed recovery attempts. Standard payment gateways rely on basic retr[...]

## How It Works

Recovery Copilot processes payments through a strict five-stage pipeline (**Diagnose → Decide → Execute → Stop → Report**):

1. **Diagnose**: Classifies why a payment failed based on the structured gateway failure code. This step is deterministic and does not use an LLM, ensuring speed and reliability.
2. **Decide**: Maps the failure diagnosis to a specific action using a strict rule-lookup table. A confidence gate checks the classification certainty; if the confidence is below the defined thres[...]
3. **Execute**: Simulates the recovery action (such as instant retry, 24-hour delayed retry, SMS nudges, or request for new payment method). If it is a nudge or payment method update, the LLM gene[...]
4. **Stop**: Enforces limits to protect user experience. A stopping rule stops retrying if the attempts exceed `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`, and a self-check blocks the system from repeating an action tha[...]
5. **Report**: Synthesizes execution data, showing gross vs. **net** recovery metrics (adjusting for action costs like SMS or human labor) and logging a complete audit trail for each transaction.

### Three-Provider LLM Fallback Chain

    D -- "Success" --> Z
    D -- "All fail" --> E["Deterministic Fallback\nclassifier.py\n(rule-based, always works)"]
    E --> Z
```

> The system **never breaks** regardless of API availability. The deterministic fallback is the final guarantee.

## Key Design Decisions

- **LLM is advisory, never authoritative**: The LLM classifies the failure. The **Policy Gate** (`policy_engine.py`) makes the final financial decision using deterministic rules the LLM cannot ove[...]
- **Three-provider AI cascade**: OpenRouter → Groq → NVIDIA NIM. If all fail, deterministic rules take over. Every step is logged.
- **Stateful Recovery Context**: Each failed attempt is recorded into `stateful_predictor.py`. The next attempt receives the full context — this is what separates Recovery Copilot from a simple [...]
- **Diagnosis Source transparency**: The UI explicitly labels each diagnosis as `AI` (purple) or `DETERMINISTIC FALLBACK` (amber), so evaluators can see exactly what drove the decision.
- **Confidence Gating**: Confidence below 0.70 → forced `escalate_human`. Unknown error codes default to 0.40, ensuring they always route to human review.
- **Strict Stopping Rule**: Hard cap of `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` (default: 3) per transaction. Prevents customer spam.
- **Anti-Repetition Self-Check**: If an action was already tried and failed, the Policy Gate blocks it and forces escalation.
- **RBI/TRAI Compliance Framing**: Retry limits and messaging gates are designed in accordance with RBI e-mandate retry guidelines and TRAI DND regulations.

## UI: Story-Driven Recovery Pipeline

The frontend (`index.html`) is a single-page "Recovery Story" — not a metrics dashboard. It tells the story of one payment failure resolved through the pipeline:

| Section | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Failed Payment** | The transaction that triggered recovery (₹4,500 · `bank_server_down`) |
| **AI Diagnosis** | Classification result, confidence score, and source (AI or DETERMINISTIC FALLBACK) |
| **Policy Gate** | APPROVED / BLOCKED badge + the exact rules that fired |
| **Execution** | Which action was taken and what the LLM-generated message looked like |
| **Next Best Action** | What the stateful predictor recommends next (from recovery context) |
| **Attempt Timeline** | Chronological attempt history with `RECOVERY CONTEXT UPDATED` markers between attempts |
| **Technical Audit** | Expandable JSON-level detail for every field of every attempt |
| **Benchmark** | Recovery rates across 4 synthetic distribution scenarios (anti-cherry-picking proof) |

## Changelog

### v0.4 — Demo Integrity & Frontend Overhaul (2026-08-26)
- **Fixed critical demo inconsistency**: Removed `|| t.failure_code === 'bank_server_down'` fallback in transaction lookup that caused the UI to display a random ₹7,466 transaction instead of t[...]
- **Canonical demo transaction**: Now always identified by exact `payment_id === 'demo_pay_ref_4500'` match. If not found, UI shows seed instruction rather than silently loading wrong data.
- **RESET DEMO no longer calls `/transactions/generate`**: That endpoint appended 60 random rows on every click, which polluted the DB and shadowed the canonical demo transaction. Reset now just [...]
- **Diagnosis Source labels**: Badge now explicitly shows `AI` (purple) or `DETERMINISTIC FALLBACK` (amber) — never the internal string `"Deterministic Rules"`.
- **Diagnosis card expanded**: Added `Source` as a separate labeled field alongside `Diagnosis` and `Confidence` in a 3-column grid.
- **Recovery-in-progress copy fixed**: Replaced "Waiting for next execution step or human escalation path" with clear "Attempt N complete. Outcome recorded as context for next decision."
- **LLM model names fixed**: `OPENROUTER_MODEL` corrected from invalid `openrouter/free` to `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`; `GROQ_MODEL` updated from deprecated `llama-3.1-8b-instant` to[...]
- **Per-provider timeout**: Reduced from 10s → 6s so the 3-provider cascade completes faster.
- **Error logging improvement**: LLM classifier now logs HTTP status code alongside exception type for faster debugging.

### v0.3 — Stateful Predictor & Audit Trail (2026-08-25)

## Demo Setup

> Run this once before any demo or recording:

```bash
python scripts/seed_demo.py
```

This creates a fresh `demo_pay_ref_4500` transaction (₹4,500 · `bank_server_down`) with zero prior attempts. The UI will then tell the complete recovery story from scratch when you click **RUN[...]

To fully reset between demo runs (clear all prior attempts):
```bash
python scripts/seed_demo.py  # idempotent — deletes and re-creates the demo transaction
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Replay Harness — Anti-Cherry-Picking Proof

```bash
python scripts/replay_harness.py
```

Runs recovery cycles across 4 distinct failure distributions to prove the engine isn't overfit to a single dataset:

| Scenario | Description | Expected Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `baseline` | Normal distribution | ~35–45% recovery rate |
| `card_heavy` | High expired card / invalid CVV | Lower recovery (customer-side failures) |
| `infra_heavy` | High bank_server_down / network_timeout | Higher recovery (infra failures resolve on retry) |
| `ambiguous_heavy` | High generic declines | More escalations (low confidence → human review) |

## Roadmap (Intentionally Deferred)

1. **Real payment gateway execution**: Deferred to avoid introducing real financial side effects in simulation mode. The current execution adapter uses deterministic simulation while preserving the standard schema.

2. **Real SMS/Email delivery**: Deferred to avoid Twilio/SendGrid external API rate-limit dependencies. LLM-generated recovery messages are generated and recorded in the audit trail to demonstrate the complete pipeline.

3. **Natural-language dashboard queries**: Deferred — text-to-SQL introduces prompt-injection and data-access risks. Deterministic aggregations and existing API endpoints are preferred for the [...]

4. **Automated cron reporting**: Deferred — requires Celery + broker infrastructure and persistent scheduling. The current API exposes recovery summaries and outcome datasets synchronously.

5. **Online model retraining**: Deferred — continuously retraining recovery models from live outcomes requires a validated production dataset and model evaluation pipeline. The current system r[...]

6. **Adaptive policy learning**: Deferred — automatically modifying financial safety thresholds based on observed outcomes would require policy versioning, simulation, approval workflows, and r[...]

7. **Human-in-the-loop operations console**: Deferred — the current system supports `escalate_human` as a controlled execution outcome, while a dedicated review queue, approval workflow, and SL[...]

8. **Production-scale distributed workers**: Deferred — the current implementation uses thread-based parallel processing for independent transactions. Distributed queues, workers, Redis/Kafka, [...]

9. **Advanced customer-level personalization**: Deferred — customer recovery profiles require longitudinal payment history and additional privacy/data-governance controls. Current decisioning o[...]

10. **Live provider optimization**: Deferred — dynamic routing between OpenRouter, NVIDIA NIM, Groq, and local models based on latency, cost, and quality requires production telemetry. The curr[...]

11. **Real-time anomaly detection**: Deferred — detecting unusual recovery rates, provider failures, or policy violations requires continuous monitoring and alerting infrastructure. Current ben[...]

12. **Full compliance and governance layer**: Deferred — immutable audit storage, model/version provenance, policy versioning, retention controls, and formal compliance reporting are production[...]
